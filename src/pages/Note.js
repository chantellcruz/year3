                <p>Hi boyfriend. :-)
                    I hope you enjoy this lil webpage that I made and don't think if it's too cringe.
                    If you think it's too cringe...  it's too late.
                    It is on the internet now. :0
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Anyway, I just wanted to remind you that I love you sm and that I feel so lucky to be dating you.
                    I enjoy all our stupid shenanigans, hikes, travels, and just doing anything together.
                    I hope we have plenty more adventures because I like you too much now.
                </p>
